# Surya Murthy – Personal Research Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal academic website, built using the **Bulma CSS framework** and inspired by the clean, content-focused structure of **Po-han Li's personal website**.  
The site presents my research in cooperative multi-agent systems, preference-aligned learning, and urban air mobility.
